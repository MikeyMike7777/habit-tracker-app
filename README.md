# Smart Habit Tracker Project

## Overview
The Smart Habit Tracker is a mobile application designed to help users build and maintain positive habits through daily tracking and progress visualization. This app allows users to set up custom habits, monitor their progress over time, and stay motivated by visualizing their progress.

The Smart Habit Tracker focuses on simplicity and user-friendliness, ensuring that users can concentrate on their goals without getting overwhelmed by complex features.

## Project Goals
- Develop a mobile app using React Native that helps users build and track habits.
- Apply core React Native concepts such as state management, navigation, and data storage.

## Project Features

1. **Habit Creation:**
   - Users can add new habits by providing details like the name, description, start date, and frequency (e.g., daily, weekly).
   - Data should be managed efficiently using appropriate data structures.

2. **Daily Check-ins:**
   - Users can mark habits as completed on a daily basis.
   - Implement local data storage using `AsyncStorage` to persist user data.

3. **Progress Visualization:**
   - Display the userâ€™s progress with habits using visual elements like charts.
   - Use a chart library to visualize progress data (e.g., bar charts, line charts).

4. **User Interface and Experience:**
   - Create a clean, user-friendly interface.
   - Ensure seamless navigation using React Navigation.

## Technical Requirements
- **Technologies:** React Native, React Navigation, AsyncStorage, Chart libraries (e.g., `react-native-chart-kit`), Context API.
- **Tools:** Visual Studio Code, Git for version control, React Native CLI/Expo for development.
- **Platforms:** The app should be developed for both iOS and Android.

## Evaluation Criteria
The project will be evaluated based on the following criteria:

1. **Folder Structure:**
   - The organization of the project's folder structure should be logical and scalable.
   - Code and assets should be grouped in a way that enhances readability and maintainability.

2. **Reusability:**
   - Components should be designed for reuse where applicable.
   - Code should follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles to avoid redundancy.

3. **Code Structure and Comments:**
   - The code should be well-structured, following best practices for readability and maintainability.
   - Adequate comments should be provided to explain the purpose of complex logic and components, making the codebase easier to understand.

## Deliverables
- A fully functional Smart Habit Tracker app for both iOS and Android.
- Clean, maintainable code with comments where necessary.
- Documentation for the app, including setup instructions and an overview of key components.

## Next Steps
- Begin development according to the outlined plan.
- Regularly update on progress and any potential roadblocks.
- Final deliverable should be completed within one week.
